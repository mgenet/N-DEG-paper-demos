# Welcome to [[Genet (2023). Finite strain formulation of the discrete equilibrium gap principle: application to mechanically consistent regularization for large motion tracking. Comptes Rendus Mécanique.](https://doi.org/10.5802/crmeca.228)]'s demos!

Demos can be browsed statically but also interactively—to start a session and run the code just click on the rocket icon at the top of a tutorial page and then click on "Binder".

(Code for the demos is at [https://github.com/mgenet/N-DEG-paper-demos](https://github.com/mgenet/N-DEG-paper-demos), main library at [https://github.com/mgenet/dolfin_warp](https://github.com/mgenet/dolfin_warp).)
